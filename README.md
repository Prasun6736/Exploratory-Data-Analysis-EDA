### Project Overview

This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the dataset to master the exploratory data analysis (EDA) in banking with Pandas framework.

### Goals of the Project

1. Explore a dataset with Pandas framework.
2. Gettting meaningful insights.
3. Visualize the dataset with various plot types.

### Used Libraries

1. NUMPY
2. PANDAS
3. MATPLOTLIB

### Methods and Materials

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in the data science workflow, helping us to understand the data, uncover patterns, spot anomalies, and form hypotheses. Below are some of the key steps and visualizations used in our EDA process - 
1. Data Overview
2. Handling Missing Values
3. Data Visualization
4. Outlier Detection and Removal
This section provides a clear and concise overview of the EDA process .
